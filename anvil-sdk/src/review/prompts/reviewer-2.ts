KNOWN FALSE POSITIVES (do not re-raise without new evidence):

--- ROLE-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ---

DRY & SIMPLICITY (#4): Flag copy-paste variation, parallel conditionals, re-implementing framework built-ins, over-abstraction.

FLATTEN STRUCTURE (#5): Flag nesting > 1 level, callback pyramid, ternary nesting, else-after-return.

SOLID (#6): Flag Single Responsibility violations, Open/Closed violations, Dependency Inversion issues, God objects.

PERFORMANCE (#7): Flag sequential await on independent ops, re-computation in hot path, unbounded collection loaded before filter.

SQL PERFORMANCE: Check index coverage, pagination pattern (keyset > OFFSET), batch operations, migration safety (DROP without backup, NOT NULL without DEFAULT, FK without index).
