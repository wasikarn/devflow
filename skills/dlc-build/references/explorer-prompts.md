# Explorer Prompt Templates

Prompt templates for explorer teammates. Lead inserts project-specific values at `{placeholders}`.

## Explorer 1: Execution Paths

```text
You are exploring the codebase for a development task.

TASK: {task_description}
PROJECT: {project_name}
PROJECT HINTS: {project_hints}
BOOTSTRAP CONTEXT: {bootstrap_context}

YOUR FOCUS: Trace execution paths in the primary area this task will touch.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Find the entry point(s) for the area being modified
2. Trace the full request/response or event cycle
3. Document every function call, middleware, and hook in the path
4. Note patterns: naming conventions, error handling, validation
5. Identify reusable code that solves similar problems

OUTPUT: Structured findings with file:line references for every claim.
Send your findings to the team lead when done.
```

## Explorer 2: Data Model & Dependencies

```text
You are exploring the codebase for a development task.

TASK: {task_description}
PROJECT: {project_name}
PROJECT HINTS: {project_hints}
BOOTSTRAP CONTEXT: {bootstrap_context}

YOUR FOCUS: Data model, dependencies, and coupling in the area this task touches.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Map the data model: schemas, types, interfaces, migrations
2. Identify upstream and downstream dependencies
3. Document coupling points — what would break if we change X?
4. Note constraints: unique indexes, foreign keys, validation rules
5. Check for existing tests that cover this area
6. DB performance risks: identify unbounded queries, missing indexes on query conditions, and tables with large data volumes — flag these as constraints in findings

OUTPUT: Structured findings with file:line references for every claim.
Send your findings to the team lead when done.
```

## Explorer 3: Reference Implementations

```text
You are exploring the codebase for a development task.

TASK: {task_description}
PROJECT: {project_name}
PROJECT HINTS: {project_hints}
BOOTSTRAP CONTEXT: {bootstrap_context}

YOUR FOCUS: Find similar implementations in the codebase that can serve as reference.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Search for existing code that solves a similar problem
2. Document the pattern used (architecture, data flow, error handling)
3. Note deviations from the norm — where did other implementations make different choices?
4. Identify test patterns used for similar features
5. List specific files to use as templates

OUTPUT: Structured findings with file:line references for every claim.
Send your findings to the team lead when done.
```

## Lead Notes

When constructing explorer prompts:

1. Replace all `{placeholders}` with actual values
2. Insert project-specific `PROJECT HINTS` from CLAUDE.md conventions
3. Insert validate command from [phase-gates.md](phase-gates.md) project detection (for reference context)
4. Explorer 3 is optional — spawn only if similar existing features exist
5. All explorer findings are merged by lead into `.claude/dlc-build/research.md` — every section must cite file:line references
