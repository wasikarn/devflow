## Scoring Rubric (100 points)

| Criterion | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| Commands/workflows | 15 |
| Architecture clarity | 15 |
| Retrieval readiness | 15 |
| Conciseness | 15 |
| Non-obvious patterns | 10 |

| Actionability | 10 |

## Score Breakdown

**15/15 Commands:** All essential commands with context, dev workflow clear
**10/15:** Most commands present, some missing context
**5/15:** Basic commands only, no workflow
**0/15:** No commands

**15/15 Architecture:** Key dirs explained, module relationships, entry points, data flow
**10/15:** Good overview, minor gaps
**5/15:** Basic directory listing only
**0/15:** No architecture info

**15/15 Retrieval readiness:** Has retrieval directive ("Prefer retrieval-led reasoning..."), docs index pointing to retrievable files, explore-first wording throughout
**10/15:** Has retrieval directive but no docs index, or uses some "MUST" directives
**5/15:** Partial retrieval guidance, mostly invoke-first wording
**0/15:** No retrieval guidance, full docs embedded inline, or absolute directives only

**15/15 Conciseness:** Dense valuable content, no noise, no redundancy (exclude auto-generated sections like `<claude-mem-context>` from size measurement)
**10/15:** Mostly concise, some padding or noise
**5/15:** Verbose in places, generic advice present
**0/15:** Mostly filler or noise

**10/10 Non-obvious:** Gotchas captured, workarounds, edge cases, unusual pattern reasons
**7/10:** Some patterns documented
**3/10:** Minimal
**0/10:** None

**10/10 Novel content:** Post-cutoff APIs documented in detail with examples, well-known patterns compressed or removed. Custom/internal APIs thoroughly documented
**7/10:** Some novel content identified, but incomplete coverage
**3/10:** Treats all content equally regardless of novelty
**0/10:** Only documents well-known patterns, misses post-cutoff or custom APIs

**10/10 Currency:** Reflects current codebase, commands work, refs accurate
**7/10:** Mostly current, minor staleness
**3/10:** Several outdated references — ⚠️ CRITICAL if score < 5 (stale CLAUDE.md is actively harmful)
**0/10:** Severely outdated

**10/10 Actionability:** Copy-paste ready, concrete steps, real paths
**7/10:** Mostly actionable
**3/10:** Some vague instructions
**0/10:** Theoretical

## Grades

| Grade | Score |
| --- | --- |
| A | 90–100 |
| B | 70–89 |
| C | 50–69 |
| D | 30–49 |
| F | 0–29 |

## Project Coverage Scoring (100 points)

Separate from the CLAUDE.md Quality rubric above. Measures adoption of Claude Code features relative to what's applicable for the specific project.

### How to assess

1. **Determine applicability** — for each of 12 categories, decide if the feature applies based on project context
2. **Score each applicable category 0-3** — Missing (0), Minimal (1), Partially adopted (2), Fully adopted (3)
3. **Calculate** — `(sum of scores / (applicable × 3)) × 100`

### Scoring guidelines per category

| Category | 3 (Full) | 2 (Partial) | 1 (Minimal) | 0 (Missing) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CLAUDE.md | <200 lines, current, actionable | Good but missing 1-2 sections | Exists but sparse/stale | No CLAUDE.md |
| `.claude/rules/` | Path-scoped with `paths` frontmatter | Rules exist, no path scoping | Empty rules dir | Should have, doesn't |
| Skills | Proper frontmatter, trigger-complete descriptions | Exist but missing fields | Minimal frontmatter | Workflows uncaptured |
| Subagents | Tools/model/memory configured, auto-trigger | Exist but missing key fields | Basic definition only | Delegation would help |
| Output styles | `keep-coding-instructions` correct | Exist but wrong config | Minimal style file | Tone needed, no styles |
| Hooks | Events matched, guards in place | Exist but no guards | 1-2 hooks only | Automation unaddressed |
| Permissions | Project-level allow/deny rules | Some rules, incomplete | User-level defaults only | Ops unprotected |
| Settings | Meaningful customization | Some, not optimized | Only defaults | Config needed, not set |
| Scheduled tasks | Optimal intervals configured | Set up, not optimal | Basic only | Needs unaddressed |
| Plugins | Valid manifest, tested | Exists but untested | Partial manifest | Distribution needed |
| MCP | Servers configured, scoped | Exist, broad scope | Basic config | Tools needed, not wired |
| Agent teams | Structure, task sizing set | Work, coordination issues | Basic team only | Parallel work sequential |

### Key principle

100/100 is achievable for any project — it means "all applicable features properly used". A simple CLI tool with just CLAUDE.md + hooks can score 100.

## Red Flags

- Commands that would fail (wrong paths, missing deps)
- References to deleted files/folders
- Outdated tech versions
- Copy-paste from templates without customization
- Generic advice not specific to the project
- "TODO" items never completed
- Duplicate info across multiple CLAUDE.md files

## Vercel-Aligned Quick Checks

These patterns are now scored within the main rubric (Retrieval readiness + Novel content criteria). Use this as a quick pass/fail checklist:

| Check | Pass |
| --- | --- |
| Retrieval directive | Has "Prefer retrieval-led reasoning" or equivalent |
| Wording style | Explore-first / "Prefer X" framing |
| Novel content | Post-cutoff APIs detailed, known patterns compressed |
| Docs index | Pointer to retrievable docs (if framework project) |
| Self-invocation | Reminder to run `/optimize-claude-md` when stale |
| Noise-free | No generic advice, no obvious patterns |

## Assessment Process

1. Read CLAUDE.md completely
2. Detect framework + version, identify post-cutoff APIs
3. Cross-reference with actual codebase (check files exist, commands work)
4. Score each criterion (100-point rubric — Vercel patterns integrated)
5. Run quick checks (retrieval, wording, noise, docs index)
6. **Eval-based validation:** Run 2-3 commands, verify paths, test docs index retrievability
7. Calculate total, assign grade
8. List specific issues with improvement suggestions

## Vercel Research

**Why passive context wins** ([Vercel research](https://vercel.com/blog/agents-md-outperforms-skills-in-our-agent-evals)):

> Vercel uses `AGENTS.md`; Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md` — same concept, same results.

| Config | Overall | Build | Lint | Test |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline (no docs) | 53% | 84% | 95% | 63% |
| Skills (default) | 53% | 84% | 89% ↓ | 58% ↓ |
| Skills (instructed) | 79% | 95% | 100% | 84% |
| **AGENTS.md** | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** |

Compressed context (8KB) performs identically to verbose (40KB). Passive wins: no decision point about when to retrieve, consistent every turn, no sequencing issues.

**Target expectations:**

| Vercel's 100% pass rate |
| ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent completes tasks (build/lint/test) successfully |
| Achieved by having good passive context |

- **Grade B (70+) + no critical criterion below 10** = good baseline
- **Grade A (90+)** = ideal for framework-heavy or complex projects
- Fully autonomous — all 5 phases run without user-confirmation gates
